## **crewai_daily_report**

Welcome to the `crewai_daily_report` project! This project leverages AI agents to automate the process of researching, writing, and critiquing daily reports on the latest AI trends.

### **Project Overview**
The `crewai_daily_report` project consists of three AI agents: Researcher, Writer, and Critic, working sequentially to deliver high-quality articles on AI trends. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Researcher Agent**: Gathers up-to-date information on the latest AI topics and trends.
2. **Writer Agent**: Uses the gathered information to draft a blog post or article.
3. **Critic Agent**: Reviews the draft, ensuring it meets quality standards and provides feedback for improvements.

This process is recurring, ensuring continuous production of relevant and insightful content.
